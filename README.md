#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process whereby software is designed, developed, tested and maintianed in a scientific apporach in the industry. 
In today's world almost everthing we do relies on software one way or another. From banking and medical healthcare and even transportation, software helps in the technological industry by Aautomating and making processes simple, improving the accuracy and enhancing the user's experience. Without software engineering, I think businesses would struggle with system failure and security vulnerabilities. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of Programming Languages(1950's-1960's): Before the 1950's, computers were programmed using raw machine code, which was tedious and error-prone. Then came the Fortran and C, making it easier to to understand write some of these codes. The languages laid the foundation for mordern programming, which allows developers to create more complex software.

2. Software engineering becomes a real didcipline (1960): People started realizing that writing code wasn't just an easy task as software programs grew more complicated. It lacked management and planning too. By the late 1960's, software engineering was recognized as a field on it's own. This was a game changer.

3. The shift to agile development (2000): Softwares were mostly built using the Waterfall model in the early days, where everything was planned and followed a strict procedure. But this often led to slow development and a lack of flexibility. By 2000s, Agile methodologies took over and this encouraged continuous improvements. This made software engineering much more efficient for technological companies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5 Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 1. Waterfall Methodology: A linear approach where each phase (planning, design, development, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next.
 This methodology is best for: Large projects with well-defined requirements, such as government or banking systems while;
 2. Agile Methodology: A flexible approach with iterative development, frequent testing, and continuous feedback is best for: Dynamic projects where requirements may change, such as mobile app development or startups launching new products.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Debugging Complex Bugs: Use debugging tools and peer code reviews.
 Keeping Up with New Technologies: Follow tech blogs, take courses, and participate in developer communities.
 Managing Deadlines: Use project management tools like Jira or Trello and break tasks into manageable chunks.
 Security Issues: Follow secure coding practices and regularly update dependencies.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting clear, precise instructions to get the best responses from AI models. Since AI models respond based on how they interpret prompts, a well-designed prompt can lead to more accurate, useful, and relevant answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 1. Vague Prompt: “Tell me about cars.”
 2. Improved Prompt: “Explain how electric vehicles work and their advantages over gasoline-powered cars.”
The improved prompt is more effective because it gives clear direction. It tells the AI exactly what information to focus on, reducing the chance of getting an overly broad or irrelevant answer.
